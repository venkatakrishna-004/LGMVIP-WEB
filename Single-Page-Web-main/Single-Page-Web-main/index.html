                            the world's heritage.The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural
                            achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic
                            beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow;
                            such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of
                            lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever
                            changing tints and moods.The four free-standing minarets at the corners of the platform
                            added a hitherto unknown dimension to the Mughal architecture. The four minarets provide not
                            only a kind of spatial reference to the monument but also give a three dimensional effect to
                            the edifice. </p>

                            above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s
                            renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of
                            mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its
                            exact former use remains a mystery. More than 7,000 feet above sea level in the Andes
                            Mountains, Machu Picchu is the most visited tourist destination in Peru. 
                            Between 1537 – 1545, as the small Spanish army and its allies started to gain ground over
                            the Inca Empire, Manco Inca abandoned Machu Picchu, fleeing to safer retreats. The residents
                            took with them their most valuable belongings and destroyed Inca trails connecting Machu
                            Picchu with the rest of the empire.In 1997, an American tourist plunged to her death after
                            slipping on a mountain path overlooking Machu Picchu. </p>

                            sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face.The statue of Christ the Redeemer has become a

                            Corcovado overlooking Rio de Janeiro. At 98 feet tall, it sits on a 26-foot pedestal with an

                            Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and
                            is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age.The Colosseum
                            is famous because it is an origin of gladiator battles that took place in the time of Roman
                            Empire. Moreover, Dion Cassius claimed that 9000 wild animals were killed in the one hundred
                            days of celebrations which inaugurated the amphitheater.The Colosseum was built as part of
                            an imperial effort to revitalize Rome after the tumultuous year of the four emperors, 69 CE.
                            As with other amphitheatres, the emperor Vespasian intended the Colosseum to be an
                            entertainment venue, hosting gladiator fights, animal hunts, and even mock naval battles.
                            Such famous venues as the Colosseum and Circus Maximus of Rome would host events involving
                            magnificent processions, exotic animals, gladiator battles, chariot races, executions and
                            even mock naval battles.Flavian emperor Vespasian had this amphitheatre that could
                            accommodate 65,000 spectators built in the year 72 CE.
